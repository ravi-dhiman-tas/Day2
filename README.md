# Day2

This project is my 100DaysOfCode challenge to setup and run Angular2.0

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Build with webpack-dev-server

Run `npm run build:prod` to build the project for production.

## Run webpack-dev-sever

Run `npm run serve` to run webpack-dev-server on `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
